It has been an awesome time working on Carch from [v4.0.0](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.0.0) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

With 5 months of time and 1.4k+ commits, it has been an insane time for Carch improvement.

As we obviously improved a lot compared to v4.0.0.

Here are some things I remember that have been added/changed:

### 🚀 Rust Implementation

- From the start of Linux, I kinda liked Rust. Always wanted to make something, but kind of skill issue in Rust I couldn’t do that frequent.
- But **today**, we have implemented a **TUI for Carch** that is *fucking fast*, working perfectly fine, beautiful as well, with the most needed functionality.
- Also, the **entire Carch script is in Rust**, which is pretty fast compared to v4.0.0 where all of Carch was dependent on Bash.

### 🛠️ Massive Improvement in Scripts

- We have added **a lot of scripts** for setup that, for example, take me just 30 minutes to set up *all* the things like full working env with window manager, beautiful Neovim, terminal, Rofi, and all the stuff.
- Also, the scripts have been **improved a lot** compared to v4.0.0.
- Where in v4.0.0, *some* scripts worked now in v5.0.0, **most or all scripts work fine**.
- Also important, we have **expanded Carch support for Fedora Linux too yoooooo!**
- Carch is now supported on **Arch as well as Fedora-based systems** with all scripts that work just fine on both.
- Yeah, maybe somewhere it may fail, but I have given my best in that and mostly guarantee that most things or all will work just fine.
- Just run it it will do everything for you.
- Also, we have changed the **repo structure** with proper directories in place.
- Now, it has an **install script** that just does everything without any problem.

### 📚 Docs

- Main thing I’ve been working on for the past days is the **[documentation site](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np)**.
- The documentation site has been **rewritten**. It now supports **multi-language**: [ 🇺🇸 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np) • [ 🇳🇵 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/ne/) • [ 🇮🇳 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/hi/) • [ 🇨🇳 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/zh/) • [ 🇪🇸 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/es/) • [ 🇦🇪 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/ar/) • [ 🇫🇷 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/fr/) • [ 🇰🇷 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/ko/) • [ 🇩🇪 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/de/) • [ 🇷🇺 ](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np/ru/)
- The documentation site has been **massively improved**. Now all the guides are just simple enough that anyone can understand.
- As well, now **more communities** can read this by switching the language.
- Also, the main repo [README](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/blob/main/.github/README.md) is also available in different languages, as you can see there.
- If you want to see Carch docs in your language, you can **contribute to Carch Docs** you can find the repo at [carch-org/docs](http://github.com/carch-org/docs)

### ⚡ Performance & UI/UX

- Many improvements, bug fixes, and **UI/UX enhancements with the Rust TUI**.
- **Carch performance has improved now 80% faster than v4.0.0**.

## 👀 Preview

Here is the **side-by-side comparison** of v4.0.0 with v5.0.0:

</p>

You can see we now have a TUI that is *beautiful*, not gonna lie.

And at last, this is the **version 5.0.0**, and I am very happy to announce this!  
Version 4 has been a great time for improvement.

Also, thanks to contributors who contributed to this project.

I am fucking smiling all the time seeing the [docs](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np) because it is the **most beautiful thing I have ever made or seen**, with those multi language options…

Yeah, a lot of effort. Working 12 hours on some days it’s been a hard time, but I **enjoyed it a lot**.

**Enjoy the update Carch will be improved more in the upcoming days as long as I maintain this.**

Much love,  
**Hari ❤️**
