wohhhhh

#### Let's gooo!  
Finally, we are on **v5.0.0** of the Carch release. This has been a massive improvement back and forth and fun working from part version [4.0.0](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.0.0).I think from v4.0.0 to v5.0.0 it's been about **5 months** and with **1.4k+ commits** on the repo including the docs part. Yeah, it's a lot... or kind of not too. But yeah, there is massive improvement on Carch. Also, I have learned many, many things while working on this project.Learned a lot about how things work, explored many new things as well, and a lot more too. Many headaches and frustrations came with it, but that's okay. I can't express it, but I am very happy that Carch is at this point, as this started as just a kind of test script I was doing here and there in my starting days of Linux. But today, with Carch, I have learned a lot about Linux, as well as scripting and many more things that you can clearly see in this project. Yeah, first of all, thanks to the Linux community. Yeah, they have insane level projects and give time to them with no expectation in return. Appreciate their effort always. The main reason Carch has come to this point is mainly because of this community and kind of me too. Like I do here and there, see new stuff, see how things work, learn new things as Linux is always a learning curve for me or for anyone else. Yeah, thanks to all. And **you**, who are reading this also thanks for that.

#### Ok, enough yapping.  
Now, the changes I will discuss we get compared to v4.0.0:

### 🚀 Rust Implementation

- From the start of Linux, I kinda liked Rust. Always wanted to make something, but kind of skill issue in Rust I couldn’t do that frequent.
- But **today**, we have implemented a **TUI for Carch** that is *fucking fast*, working perfectly fine, beautiful as well, with the most needed functionality.
- Also, the **entire Carch script is in Rust**, which is pretty fast compared to v4.0.0 where all of Carch was dependent on Bash.

### 🛠️ Massive Improvement in Scripts

- We have added **a lot of scripts** for setup that, for example, take me just 30 minutes to set up *all* the things like full working env with window manager, beautiful Neovim, terminal, Rofi, and all the stuff.
- Also, the scripts have been **improved a lot** compared to v4.0.0.
- Where in v4.0.0, *some* scripts worked now in v5.0.0, **most or all scripts work fine**.
- Also important, we have **expanded Carch support for Fedora Linux too yoooooo!**
- Carch is now supported on **Arch as well as Fedora-based systems** with all scripts that work just fine on both.
- Yeah, maybe somewhere it may fail, but I have given my best in that and mostly guarantee that most things or all will work just fine.
- Just run it it will do everything for you.
- Also, we have changed the **repo structure** with proper directories in place.
- Now, it has an **install script** that just does everything without any problem.

### 📚 Docs

- Main thing I’ve been working on for the past days is the **documentation site**.
- The documentation site has been **rewritten**. It now supports **multi-language**: 🇺🇸 • 🇳🇵 • 🇮🇳 • 🇨🇳 • 🇪🇸 • 🇦🇪 • 🇫🇷 • 🇰🇷 • 🇩🇪 • 🇷🇺
- The documentation site has been **massively improved**. Now all the guides are just simple enough that anyone can understand.
- As well, now **more communities** can read this by switching the language.
- Also, the main repo README is also available in different languages, as you can see there.
- If you want to see Carch docs in your language, you can **contribute to Carch Docs** you can find the repo at [carch-org/docs](http://github.com/carch-org/docs)

### ⚡ Performance & UI/UX

- Many improvements, bug fixes, and **UI/UX enhancements with the Rust TUI**.
- **Carch performance has improved now 80% faster than v4.0.0**.

## 👀 Preview

Here is the **side-by-side comparison** of v4.0.0 with v5.0.0:

</p>

You can see we now have a TUI that is *beautiful*, not gonna lie.

And at last, this is the **version 5.0.0**, and I am very happy to announce this!  
Version 4 has been a great time for improvement.

Also, thanks to contributors who contributed to this project.

I am fucking smiling all the time seeing the [docs](https://carch.chalisehari.com.np) because it is the **most beautiful thing I have ever made or seen**, with those multi language options…

Yeah, a lot of effort. Working 12 hours on some days it’s been a hard time, but I **enjoyed it a lot**.

**Enjoy the update Carch will be improved more in the upcoming days as long as I maintain this.**

Thanks for all.  
**Much love ❤️**
